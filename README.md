# Converting Regular Expression to NFA

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates the conversion of regular expressions to Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) using Thompson's construction algorithm. It provides an interactive visualization of the step-by-step process of building an NFA from a regular expression.

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand the relationship between regular expressions and NFAs
2. Learn Thompson's construction algorithm
3. Visualize the step-by-step conversion process
4. Test and validate the constructed NFA
5. Understand the equivalence of regular expressions and NFAs

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of regular expressions
- Knowledge of finite automata concepts
- Familiarity with basic set theory

## Experiment Structure
The experiment consists of the following components:

1. **Input Section**
   - Regular expression input field
   - Example expressions
   - Start construction button

2. **Construction Visualization**
   - Step-by-step NFA construction
   - Interactive navigation controls
   - Auto-play feature
   - Progress tracking

3. **NFA Display**
   - Visual representation of states and transitions
   - Clear labeling of start and accept states
   - Epsilon transition visualization

4. **Testing Section**
   - String input for testing
   - Acceptance/rejection feedback
   - Multiple test cases

## How to Use
1. Enter a regular expression or select an example
2. Click "Start Construction" to begin
3. Use navigation controls to step through the construction
4. Observe how each operator affects the NFA
5. Test the constructed NFA with various strings
