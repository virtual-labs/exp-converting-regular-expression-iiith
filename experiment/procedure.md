1. **Enter Regular Expression**
   - Type a regular expression in the input field
   - Use the example buttons to try pre-defined expressions
   - Click "Start Construction" to begin

2. **Step-by-Step Construction**
   - Use "Next Step" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the construction
   - Watch how each operator (|, *, +, ·) affects the NFA
   - Observe the stack of NFAs being built
   - Use "Auto Play" to see the construction automatically

3. **Understanding the NFA**
   - Green circle represents the start state
   - Red double circle represents accept state
   - Arrows show transitions with their labels
   - ε represents epsilon transitions

4. **Testing the NFA**
   - Enter a test string in the test section
   - Click "Test" to see if the string is accepted
   - Try different strings to understand the language

5. **Examples to Try**
   - Basic: "a", "b"
   - Union: "a|b"
   - Concatenation: "ab"
   - Star: "a*"
   - Complex: "(a|b)*abb"
